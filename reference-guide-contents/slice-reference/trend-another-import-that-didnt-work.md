A typical marker object is defined by the following properties:

**shape**: line\|line-dashed\|rect \(**required, will not draw if left empty**\)

`x1`: start x value \(if left empty, will pick the leftmost X axis point\)

`x2`: end x value \(if left empty, will pick the right X axis point\)

`y1`: start y value \(if left empty, will pick the bottom Y axis point\)

`y2`: end y value \(if left empty, will pick the top Y axis point\)

`position`: above\|below \(default\) - indicates whether the shape should be positioned above/below the series

`classed`: a string that contains the class names to be attached to the marker \(eg: “marker-1 marker-red”\)

`label`: the label string that will be used in legend

`tooltipContent`: tooltip HTML content that will appear when hovered over the shape and the label
