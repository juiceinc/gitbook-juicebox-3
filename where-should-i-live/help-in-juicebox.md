# Help in Juicebox

## Enabling help

For help to be displayed[ show\_help](../reference-guide-contents/app.yaml.md#app-yaml-options) needs to be `true` in the [app.yaml](../reference-guide-contents/app.yaml.md).

## Building help

The app contains a `help/` directory and each stack can also \(optionally\) contain a `help/` directory.

Those `help/` directories contain either a `help.html` document or a `help.md` document in Markdown format.
