# Before We Begin

## Overview

In this tutorial, we are going to be looking at what Juicebox is, how to use it, and build something using a lot of the core features you are likely to encounter in a great number of Juicebox apps you will build here. This tutorial is meant to be a guide that teaches you to think like a Juice developer and give you the tools necessary to help you solve issues as they arise, and while the base tutorial won't get into a lot that the product can do, we will be creating advanced tutorials that build off of what you will build here that will help lay out a more exhaustive base for you to build on.

If you have any ideas on advanced topics that you'd love to see covered in the advanced tutorials, feel free to reach out to Seth about making that. No promises, but depending on time constraints, he would love to help out.

## Section Breakdown

### [Part 1 - Getting to Know Juicebox](tutorial-part-2.md)

In this section, we are going to be looking at some core concepts, the layout, and some common blah blah blah \(UPDATE ME WHEN THIS PART IS WRITTEN\). If you want a bit of a deeper look at the concepts, head[ over here](../concepts/). Becoming familiar with this will be very helpful for the tutorial, but not necessary.

### [Part 2 - Folder Structure and App Configuration](tutorial-part-3.md)

Here we will go over how to create a Juicebox app, what the different options mean, and what you'll see once you create your first Juicebox app.

### [Part 3 - Building Data Services](part-3-building-data-services.md)

In Part 3, we'll look at how to build out data services, how to interact with the database, and dive into how picking the right ingredients and recipe can be crucial when creating an app. We'll also talk about how the frontend and backend are connected and how seamlessly you can move from one to the other. **This will easily be the meatiest section of the tutorial, so make sure you're ready to dive in deep when you get here.**

### [Part 4 - Building the Slices](part-4-building-the-slices.md)

Part 4 is going to teach you how to work with some common slice types, what their configurations look like, and how you can manipulate them to do what you want.

### [Advanced Tutorials](advanced-tutorials.md)

The last section is going to be a collection of advanced tutorials that will teach you some of the finer points of the platform and really help you unlock the hidden power that Juicebox has. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Each advanced tutorial, unless noted, will build off of your base finished product from the tutorial, so make sure you create new branches for each tutorial you want to try
