# Help in Juicebox

## Enabling help

For help to be displayed [show\_help](https://docs.juiceboxdata.com/projects/juicebox/topics/juicebox_reference/apps/index.html#show-help) needs to be `true` in [Apps](https://docs.juiceboxdata.com/projects/juicebox/topics/juicebox_reference/apps/index.html).

## Building help

The app contains a `help/` directory and each stack can also \(optionally\) contain a `help/` directory.

Those `help/` directories contain either a `help.html` document or a `help.md` document in Markdown format.
